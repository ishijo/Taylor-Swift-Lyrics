Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

[Outro]
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time4Embed

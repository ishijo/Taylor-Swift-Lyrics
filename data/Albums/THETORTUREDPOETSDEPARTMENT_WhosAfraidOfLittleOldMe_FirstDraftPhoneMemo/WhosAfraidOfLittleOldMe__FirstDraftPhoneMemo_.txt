[Verse 1]
The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about "sad"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me that I'm bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Is it a wonder I brokе? Let's hear one morе joke
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
Who's afraid of little old me?
You should be

[Post-Chorus]
You should be, you should be
You should be, you should be, you should be

[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
And say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
He wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along
[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
I was tame, I was gentle 'til your circus life made me mean
"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be

[Post-Chorus]
You should be, you should be
'Cause you lured me
And you hurt me
And you taught me

[Outro]
You caged me and you called me crazy
I am what I am, well, 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?

For the most part that was almost, sort of, what it should be. I'm gonna work on the melodies and the bridge so they don't become repetitive like that. But that's just the like framework and I might take some things out, but. Yeah just a song about being crazyEmbed

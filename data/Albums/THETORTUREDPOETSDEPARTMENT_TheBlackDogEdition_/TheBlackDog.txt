I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up thе way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a bravе man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me

I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body
Was shakin', do you hate me?
Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
I pledged and I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

[Bridge]
Six weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it

[Chorus]
And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'
[Outro]
I still can't believe it
'Cause old habits die screaming4Embed

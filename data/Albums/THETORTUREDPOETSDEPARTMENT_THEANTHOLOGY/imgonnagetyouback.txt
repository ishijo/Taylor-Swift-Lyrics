Yeah

[Verse 1]
Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
Did your research, you knew the price goin' in
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet
But I'm gonna get you back

[Post-Chorus]
I, I hear thе whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
(You're mine)

[Verse 2]
Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

[Post-Chorus]
I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
(You're mine)

[Bridge]
I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becomin' something new
Say you got somebody, I'll say I got someone too
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leavin' here with you
Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)
We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
[Post-Chorus]
I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine

[Outro]
I'm gonna get you back6Embed

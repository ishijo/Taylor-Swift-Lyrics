I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south

[Pre-Chorus]
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so

[Chorus]
I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?

[Verse 2]
You had stopped and tiltеd your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I triеd searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown

Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the "if only"

[Chorus]
So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?4Embed

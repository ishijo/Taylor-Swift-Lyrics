I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you

[Interlude]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)
It's just a game, but really (Really)
I'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
Then pull me to thе back seat (The back seat)
No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you

Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

[Verse 2]
I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Post-Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school (Feel so high school) every time I look at you
But look at you
[Outro]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand-new, full throttle (Yeah)
You already know, babe
You already know, babe7Embed

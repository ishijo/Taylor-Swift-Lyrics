No, I think it's called that. Uh, 'cause of the Greek, uh, In Greek mythology, Cassandra was brought on by Apollo to, to, always warn people of impending doom, but she was cursed to never be listened to. So, uh, read into this what you will based on our, uh, current social and cultural climate

[Verse 1]
I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

[Pre-Chorus]
When the first shot's fired, there's screamin'
In the street, there's a raging riot
When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet

[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Verse 2]
I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
Say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
What happens if it becomes who you are?

So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Bridge]
They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard

[Verse 3]
I was patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all

[Chorus]
Yeah, they killed Cassandra first 'cause I feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
Yeah, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Onto somethin'
Ah, ah, ah
They all said nothin'
'Cause blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
No one heard, not a single word, no one heard

[Outro]
When the first shot's fired, there's screamin'
In the street, there's a raging riot
When the "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet
It's so quiet
